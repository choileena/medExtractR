```

Generally, the function call to `medExtractR` is  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
note <- paste(scan(filename, '', sep = '\n', quiet = TRUE), collapse = '\n')
medExtractR(note, drug_names, unit, window_length, max_dist, ...)
```

where `...` refers to additional arguments to `medExtractR`. One of the key additional arguments is `drug_list`.

- `drug_list`, a list of other drug names (besides the drug names of interest). This list is used to shorten the search window in which `medExtractR` looks for dosing entities by truncating at the nearest mentions of a competing drug name. By default, this calls `rxnorm_druglist`, a partially cleaned and processed list of brand name and ingredient drug names in the RxNorm database.$^{1}$ This list could also incorporate other competing information besides drug names, such as drug abbreviations, symptoms, procedures, or names of laboratory measurements.

The default `rxnorm_druglist` contains far more drug names than likely needed. This results in slow run times for both `medExtractR` and `medExtractR_tapering`. This vignette will demonstrate how to create your own `drug_list` for improved performance.

```{r}
library(medExtractR)
# note file names
fn <- c(
  system.file("examples", "tacpid1_2008-06-26_note1_1.txt", package = "medExtractR"),
  system.file("examples", "tacpid1_2008-06-26_note2_1.txt", package = "medExtractR"),
  system.file("examples", "tacpid1_2008-12-16_note3_1.txt", package = "medExtractR"),
  system.file("examples", "lampid1_2016-02-05_note4_1.txt", package = "medExtractR"),
  system.file("examples", "lampid1_2016-02-05_note5_1.txt", package = "medExtractR"),
  system.file("examples", "lampid2_2008-07-20_note6_1.txt", package = "medExtractR"),
  system.file("examples", "lampid2_2012-04-15_note7_1.txt", package = "medExtractR")
)
getNote <- function(x) paste(scan(x, '', sep = '\n', quiet = TRUE), collapse = '\n')
notes <- vapply(fn, getNote, character(1))
```

Here's an example run with the last note. We're using the default argument for drug_list, the full rxnorm data.

```{r}
medExtractR(note = notes[7], drug_names = c("lamotrigine", "lamictal"),
  window_length = 130, unit = "mg", drug_list = "rxnorm")
```

Let's take a look at this note. The text highlighted yellow are drugnames found in the rxnrom druglist. We want to extract entities associated with the drugnames highlighted in blue.

![note7](note_highlight.png)

You can examine our druglist by loading `rxnorm_druglist`.

```{r}
data(rxnorm_druglist, package = 'medExtractR')
length(rxnorm_druglist)
head(rxnorm_druglist)
```

We can pass the full druglist directly to `medExtractR`.

```{r}
medExtractR(note = notes[7], drug_names = c("lamotrigine", "lamictal"),
  window_length = 130, unit = "mg", drug_list = rxnorm_druglist)
```

We can even set `drug_list` to be empty, though this would lead to many false positives.

```{r}
medExtractR(note = notes[7], drug_names = c("lamotrigine", "lamictal"),
  window_length = 130, unit = "mg", drug_list = NULL)
```

In this case, adding the drug "lorazepam" will correct our output.

```{r}
medExtractR(note = notes[7], drug_names = c("lamotrigine", "lamictal"),
  window_length = 130, unit = "mg", drug_list = 'lorazepam')
```

Before running `medExtractR` we can search for drugname values present in our notes. If we restrict our `drug_list` to only these values, the `medExtractR` function will run much faster. To do this, we can use the `string_occurs` function. The first argument is a vector of character strings to find (ie, the full drug list). The second argument is a vector of text to search (ie, all of our notes). This function also has an argument for ignoring case (`ignore.case`) as well as the number of cores available for parallel processing (`nClust`, which requires the `parallel` package).

```{r}
drug_check <- string_occurs(rxnorm_druglist, notes)
names(drug_check)
lengths(drug_check)
fnd_drugs <- drug_check[['TRUE']] # or, drug_check[[1]]
fnd_drugs
medExtractR(note = notes[7], drug_names = c("lamotrigine", "lamictal"),
  window_length = 130, unit = "mg", drug_list = fnd_drugs)
```

Additionally, we may want to search for potential drugname misspellings in our data. If we find any, we can add these to our `drug_list`. We can look for misspellings with the `string_suggestions` function. Its output should be manually reviewed as many of its suggestions should be discarded. 

```{r}
sug_drugs <- string_suggestions(fnd_drugs, notes)
sug_drugs
```

In this case, it finds two values we should include.

```{r}
all_drugs <- c(fnd_drugs, sug_drugs[,'suggestion'])
medExtractR(note = notes[7], drug_names = c("lamotrigine", "lamictal"),
  window_length = 130, unit = "mg", drug_list = all_drugs)
```
